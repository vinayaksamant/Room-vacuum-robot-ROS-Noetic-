Key Features:-
3D Robot Model: Created a 3D model of the robot and exported it into a URDF format for ROS integration.
SLAM with Gmapping: Configured the robot to perform SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) using the Gmapping algorithm for real-time mapping and localization.
Autonomous Navigation: Implemented autonomous navigation through the ROS Navigation Stack, enabling the robot to plan and execute paths in a dynamic environment.
Obstacle Classification and Identification: Integrated a camera module with YOLO V5 for object detection, enabling the robot to classify and identify obstacles in its environment.
Obstacle Avoidance: Developed an obstacle avoidance system using LIDAR data to ensure safe navigation.
